Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions around the world. Detecting it early and getting access to preventive care are essential in reducing the severity of the disease and thus improving oneâ€™s quality of life while living post diagnosis. This project builds machine learning models that examine through an expansive data set containing 21 health-related features to predict the likelihood that an individual has diabetes. Each model rakes through all the factors given and determines the most effective inputs to use in predicting the outcome probability of having diabetes. The models used were logisitc regression, neural network, random forest, and adaboost.
